Build a React (TypeScript) web app where users can design their own home layout in top view. On the home screen, users can enter or draw their plot size (width Ã— length in feet/meters), and then a grid-based canvas should appear where they can add, resize, move, and label rooms (e.g., bedroom, kitchen, hall, bathroom, garden, etc.) using drag-and-drop. Include snap-to-grid alignment, zoom and pan controls, and real-time area calculation for each room and the total layout. Add save/load project options using localStorage and a modern UI (use Tailwind + shadcn/ui). Keep it fully responsive, intuitive, and offline-friendly so even non-technical users can easily create their home plan.
